       <p>Alaska was home to native Americans for thousands of years, but in the year 1741 Russians came and claimed Alaska to be their own. This event changed the lives of the natives in a lot of different ways. They were getting sick from the illnesses brought from Russia and The USA and they were forced out of their homes. Later the United States decided that they wanted to own Alaska so they bought it from Russia. A lot of people thought it was a stupid decision at the time, but later valuable resources like  gold, oil and fish were found making it worth it for the US. In 1971 the natives claims settlement act was passed making it so they got some of their land back, but some of their land that they claim they owned was given to the US. Today Alaska still is a very unique place and useful for its resources and native culture. It faces natural disasters like tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity.</p>
