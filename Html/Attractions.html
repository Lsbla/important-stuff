    <p>There are a bunch of different attractions in Alaska that you might find interesting. Denali national park is one the many national parks in Alaska, but it’s most definitely the most popular. Home to the biggest mountain in North America, Denali national park is a place in need of your attention. You can see a plethora of wildlife including but not limited to grizzlies, wolves, moose and reindeer. If you are more of a city person then you should visit Anchorage, the biggest city in Alaska. There you can find museums, zoos and Alaska's native heritage center. Speaking of which, The Alaska Native heritage center is a cultural center representing all of Alaska’s native cultures, languages and ways of life. It is a glory to behold so please visit them if you are interested. If you want to be outside in nature, but you are also a person who likes comfort then you should try one of the many cruises in Alaska. You can go through the inside passage where you can see islands, fjords and small towns and if you're lucky you might even see whales or glaciers. We wish you the best in trying to find an attraction that fits your enjoyment and we hope you enjoyed our suggestions.</p>
