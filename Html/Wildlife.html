    <p>Alaska is heavily known for its arctic tundras and mountains, but Alaska has so much more to offer when it comes to wild life. Let's start with the arctic tundras. They are located in northern Alaska and they are one of the coldest places on earth, but still you can find animals like arctic foxes, snowy owls and muskoxes in it. Let's move a little bit down to find the Boreal forests/taigas covered in spruce and fir. It is home to Moose, wolves, lynxes and Bears. If we move even further down to the south of Alaska you will find rain forests. It has giant trees. The rain forests in Alaska are home to brown bears, eagles and other birds. All of these habitats are a part of what makes Alaska so beautiful and popular with tourists. So did any of these habitats sound interesting to you?</p>
